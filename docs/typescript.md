# TypeScript gateway

The supported operator artifact is still the Rust binary described in the
[README](../README.md). This page is the TypeScript port tracked by
[ADR 0066](./adr/0066-typescript-hono-extension-contract.md).

## Run the Node process

```bash
cd ts
npm ci
export AXOND_CONFIG=../axond.toml
export GW_INBOUND_KEY=...
./bin/axond
```

`axond.toml` is the same file the Rust binary reads. Withdrawn sections still
fail the boot. Point `AXOND_EXTENSIONS_DIR`, or `[extensions] dir`, at a
directory of `.ts`, `.js`, or `.mjs` files. Each file's default export is an
extension with `apiVersion: 1`. Restart the process to pick up a new file; do
not rebuild.

A compiled `bun build --compile` binary loads those files, but it does not
resolve packages from the extension's `node_modules`. Bundle an extension that
imports a package first (`bun build extension.ts --outfile extension.js`) and
point the directory at the bundle. The Node wrapper resolves packages from the
extension file.

## Prove it

```bash
ops/typescript-compat.sh
```

That runs the workspace tests, `tests/compat`, and `tests/compat-ts` with
`AXOND_BIN` pointed at `ts/bin/axond`.

## Extensions

| Package | Stage | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `@axond/rate-limit` | pre-dispatch | `isolate` counts in this process. `store` counts in `axond_ext_ratelimit_window`. Isolate mode can over-admit across replicas. |
| `@axond/redact` | pre-dispatch | Rewrites request JSON and SSE frames. Patterns reject nested quantifiers. |
| `@axond/tokens` | pre-auth and post-auth | Verifies `axt1.` HMAC tokens, checks revocation and epoch, and mints on `POST /api/v1/tokens` with the static key. |

Trusted extensions may `query` the process store. Untrusted ones are scoped to
the request namespace. Tables must be named `axond_ext_<name>_...`.

## Worker

`ts/packages/worker` is the Hyperdrive template. Set the Hyperdrive id, keep
caching disabled, and bundle the Worker with the extensions it imports. A
compiled Bun binary loads those same extensions from disk instead.

`npm run test:workerd` boots that template under workerd. It reads
`CLOUDFLARE_HYPERDRIVE_LOCAL_CONNECTION_STRING_HYPERDRIVE` from
`AXOND_TEST_POSTGRES`, checks `GET /healthz`, and creates a namespace through
Postgres. That is Hyperdrive's local proxy against Postgres 16. PlanetScale
and a Cloudflare account are not part of this repository's test environment.

## Store

SQLite is the default. Postgres uses `dsn_env` and the schema in
`createPostgresStore`. The two extra namespace columns
`allow_platform_fallback` and `from_config` are applied by the TypeScript
process; they are not in the Rust `ops/postgres` scripts.
